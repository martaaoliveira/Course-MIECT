# Aula 01 - Notes
TODO: mostly everything (we reviewed Java)

The rest was done outside of class, due to Carnival

# Extra Notes
I've reused the generators results as input for the solver (words1->soup1->soup1_result)
In soup3_result.txt, the word Java is missing, since I've interpreted input requirement number 9 as "If a word is a subword of another, ignore the smaller one without raising any exceptions", which makes sense, otherwise it's be too hard enforce requirement number 8, as the subword would always appear twice.
